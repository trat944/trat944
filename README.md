# Hi there, I'm Jorge Revuelta! 👋

### Software Engineer | Backend & Automation Specialist

I am a Software Engineer based in Málaga, Spain, currently driving technical solutions at **Ebury**. I specialize in building scalable backend architectures, automating complex financial workflows, and integrating AI-driven document analysis systems on the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

My background in **Aviation and Education** has equipped me with a unique edge in crisis management, adaptability, and clear communication within cross-functional Agile teams.
